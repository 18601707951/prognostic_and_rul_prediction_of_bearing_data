# Prognostic and Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Bearing

This is the project of hybrid prediction based on deep learning technology.

## Key technology

+ Sparse condition encoding method
+ Shared features modeling with fault prognostic and RUL
+ Data reinforcement

## TODO

+ classification and regression on XJTU bearing dataset
+ Transfer learning appliance
+ Digital twins by Deep Conditional Generative Adversarial Neural Network(DCGAN) 

## Current difficulty

+ accuracy is not guaranteed
+ generality is not satisfied

## LICENCE
